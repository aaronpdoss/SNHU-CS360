My app was designed to allow users to create an account and login to their profile. Once logged in they would be able to input their weight and weight goals. These would be stored in an SQLite database. There is also the option to enable SMS notifications to where the app can message the user when the goal has been reached. This feature shouldn't prevent the user from using the rest of the features of the app if not enabled. The screens created for this app were a login screen, a weight goal screen, a daily weight input screen, and an achievements screen. I approached programming this project by breaking the total project up into smaller more manageable parts. This allowed for me to focus in on each specific functionality. I tested my code by checking different use cases. For example, I'd open the app and input data how I wanted to then would ensure to input data down to where the weight goal would be met. This allowed me to ensure that the notification for when the user hits their weight goal goes off. Testing processes are important to ensure that all funcitonality of the app works before deployment. I would say the main place I had to innovate was the achievements screen. That was where I free-balled and didn't have as many examples to work off of.
